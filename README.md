# Customer Churn Project

The Machine Learning project deals with the subject of 'Customer Churn' and consists in achieving reproducibility of scientific experiments.
In other words, it is a question of understanding these three articles

and, above all, of trying to replicate their experiences. Moreover, the articles provided clearly describe the specific design of the study and provide a clear and concise description of the procedures carried out and therefore, the idea is to reproduce the different studies covering the different learning objectives of this ML module ( Data preparation, predictive analysis, clustering, etc.).

The  final reports is organized according to a Data Science work methodology, particularly the CRISP methodology.
